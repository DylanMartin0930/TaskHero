## Desription ##
TaskHero is an online webapp design to foster manegable and organized productivity. As a person with ADHD, I've always had trouble staying organized and maintaining a productive workflow. Task hero aims to provide users with a platform to document projects, tasks, and goals alongside visual data representation of progress. As this webapp is aimed toward people with ADHD (not exclusively), TaskHero is designed to provide users with a sense of acomplishment and reward through consecutive streaks, and achievements.
